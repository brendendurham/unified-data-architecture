# Unified Data Architecture

A comprehensive framework for building knowledge graphs, optimizing prompts, and unifying data interactions across AI systems.

## Project Vision

The Unified Data Architecture (UDA) aims to create a seamless system that can:

- Build and maintain knowledge graphs for AI companies and their ecosystems
- Track updates across documentation, APIs, and best practices
- Optimize prompts and interactions with LLMs
- Automate context building and information retrieval
- Structure projects with proper documentation and containerization

## Key Components

### Knowledge Graph

The core of the UDA is a graph database that stores relationships between:

- Companies (e.g., Anthropic)
- Products (e.g., Claude, Claude Code)
- Protocols (e.g., MCP)
- Documentation
- Best practices

### Documentation Extractor

Automatically scrapes and processes documentation websites to extract:

- Best practices
- API references
- Implementation guides
- Updates and changes

### Prompt Library

A versioned collection of optimized prompts for various LLMs and use cases:

- Decomposed for different context windows
- Categorized by purpose and capability
- Tracked for performance and improvement

### Prompt Optimizer

Refines prompts based on performance metrics and latest best practices.

### Project Manager

Handles the setup and management of project infrastructure:

- File hierarchies
- Containerization
- Version control
- CI/CD pipelines

## MCP Integration

The UDA implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to enable seamless interactions with data sources:

- MCP Client for requesting resources
- MCP Server hosting for exposing data and tools
- Containerized MCP servers for easy deployment

## Getting Started

More comprehensive documentation and setup instructions coming soon.
